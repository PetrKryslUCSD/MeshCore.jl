# MeshCore.jl

Small package for operating on the topology of meshes for the Finite Element
Methods (FEM). All essential topological incidence relations are provided: see
the guide in [documentation](https://petrkryslucsd.github.io/MeshCore.jl/dev).
The library provides efficient storage in static arrays for speed of access.

## Usage

This release is for Julia 1.8.

The package is registered: doing
```
]add MeshCore
using MeshCore
```
is enough. 

The user can either use/import individual functions from `MeshCore` like so:
```
using MeshCore: nrelations, nentities
```

or all exported symbols maybe made available in the user's context as
```
using MeshCore.Exports
```
Using the library by itself is certainly possible.
If you wish for a more comprehensive mesh-handling package, check out
[MeshSteward.jl](https://github.com/PetrKryslUCSD/MeshSteward.jl).

## Learning

Please refer to the tutorials in the package
[`MeshTutor.jl`](https://github.com/PetrKryslUCSD/MeshTutor.jl).

## Publications

A paper was accepted to the Journal Advances in Engineering Software in April 2021. The paper is available in final draft form in the `docs/src/concepts` folder.

The package
[PaperMeshTopo](https://github.com/PetrKryslUCSD/PaperMeshTopo.jl.git) gives an
example of the construction of a complex (full one-level) topological
representation of a tetrahedral mesh.

  multiple types.
