# MeshCore.jl

Small package for operating on the topology of meshes for the Finite Element Methods (FEM). All essential topological incidence relations are provided: see the guide. The library provides efficient storage in static arrays for speed of access.

## Usage

The package is registered: doing
```
]add MeshCore
using MeshCore
```
is enough. 

The user can either use/import individual functions from `MeshCore` like so:
```
using MeshCore: nrelations, nentities
```

or all exported symbols maybe made available in the user's context as
```
using MeshCore.Exports
```
Using the library by itself is certainly possible. If you wish for a  more comprehensive mesh-handling package, check out [MeshSteward.jl](https://github.com/PetrKryslUCSD/MeshSteward.jl).

## Learning

Please refer to the tutorials in the package [`MeshTutor.jl`](https://github.com/PetrKryslUCSD/MeshTutor.jl).

## Publications

A paper is under review. The package [PaperMeshTopo](https://github.com/PetrKryslUCSD/PaperMeshTopo.jl.git) gives an example of the construction of a complex (full one-level) topological representation of a tetrahedral mesh.


## News

- 07/10/2020: Naming of the symbols has been updated to reduce conflicts.
- 07/06/2020: Exports have been added to facilitate use of the library.
- 05/14/2020: Changed storage of attribute data.
- 05/07/2020: Simplified management of attributes.
- 04/17/2020: The paper describing the library has been submitted.
- 03/21/2020: The implementation of the topology operations has been improved in
  speed and simplicity.
- 03/18/2020: The library was completely redesigned around incidence relations.
  Much simpler than before!
- 03/16/2020: Note: The coverage appears low, but that seems to be a bug in the
  computation of the coverage when applied to one-line functions defined for
  multiple types.
