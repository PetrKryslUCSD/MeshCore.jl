# MeshCore.jl

Redesign

Small package for the topology of meshes for the Finite Element Methods (FEM). All essential topological incidence relations are provided: see the guide. The library provides efficient storage of  coordinates and connectivities in static arrays for speed of access.

Note: The coverage appears low, but that seems to be a bug in the computation of the coverage
when applied to one-line functions defined for multiple types.
