# MeshCore.jl

Small package for operating on the topology of meshes for the Finite Element Methods (FEM). All essential topological incidence relations are provided: see the guide. The library provides efficient storage in static arrays for speed of access.

## News

- 03/18/2020: The library was completely redesigned around incidence relations. Much simpler than before!
- 03/16/2020: Note: The coverage appears low, but that seems to be a bug in the computation of the coverage
  when applied to one-line functions defined for multiple types.
