A shape is bounded by facets.\nEdget: shape one manifold dimension lower than the facet. For instance a tetrahedron is bounded by facets, which in turn are bounded by edges. These edges are the \"edgets\" of the tetrahedron. Edgets  can be thought of as the bounding shapes of the facets. They can also be thought of as a \"leaky\" bounding shapes of 3-D cells.\nCovering: the boundary of a 3-D cell is the union of the vertices, edges, and faces.\nShape collection: set of shapes. Each shape is defined with reference to other shapes through an incidence relation.\nIncidence relation: Map from one shape to another shape. For instance, three-dimensional finite elements are defined by the incidence relation 3 rightarrow 0, i. e. for each tetrahedron the four vertices are listed. Some incidence relations link a shape to a fixed number of other shapes, other incidence relations are of variable arity.\nConnectivity: The connectivity is the incidence relation d rightarrow 0 linking the shape (d-dimensional manifold, where d ge 0) to the set of vertices (0-dimensional manifold).\nMesh: Collection of shapes. It may be also a set of collections of shapes, but it is usually quite enough  to consider a mesh and the collection of shapes to be one and the same.  \nInitial mesh: The entry point into the library. The first mesh that was defined.\nDerived mesh: Mesh derived from another mesh through an incidence relation calculation.","category":"page"},{"location":"guide/guide.html#Example-1","page":"Guide","title":"Example","text":"","category":"section"},{"location":"guide/guide.html#","page":"Guide","title":"Guide","text":"Let us begin with a simple example of the use of the library: First import the mesh from a file and check that the correct number of entities were imported.","category":"page"},{"location":"guide/guide.html#","page":"Guide","title":"Guide","text":"mesh = import_NASTRAN(\"trunc_cyl_shell_0.nas\")\nvertices, shapes = mesh[\"vertices\"], mesh[\"shapes\"][1]\n@test (nvertices(vertices), nshapes(shapes)) == (376, 996)","category":"page"},{"location":"guide/guide.html#","page":"Guide","title":"Guide","text":"Extract zero-dimensional entities (points) by a triple application of the skeleton function.
