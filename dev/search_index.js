For instance, three-dimensional finite elements (cells) are typically linked to the vertices by the incidence relation 3 rightarrow 0, i. e. for each tetrahedron the four vertices are listed. Some incidence relations link a shape to a fixed number of other shapes, other incidence relations are of variable arity.\nFacet: shape bounding another shape. A shape is bounded by facets.\nEdget: shape one manifold dimension lower than the facet. For instance a tetrahedron is bounded by facets, which in turn are bounded by edges. These edges are the \"edgets\" of the tetrahedron.  The edgets can also be thought of as a \"leaky\" bounding shapes of 3-D cells.\nMesh topology: The mesh topology can be understood as an incidence relation between two shape collections.\nIncidence relation operations: The operations defined in the library are the skeleton, the transpose, the bounded-by for facets, and bounded-by for edgets.","category":"page"},{"location":"guide/guide.html#Example-1","page":"Guide","title":"Example","text":"","category":"section"},{"location":"guide/guide.html#","page":"Guide","title":"Guide","text":"Let us begin with a simple example of the use of the library: First import the mesh from a file:","category":"page"},{"location":"guide/guide.html#","page":"Guide","title":"Guide","text":"mesh = import_NASTRAN(\"trunc_cyl_shell_0.nas\")","category":"page"},{"location":"guide/guide.html#","page":"Guide","title":"Guide","text":"The mesh data structure can be now queried as to the incidence relations.
